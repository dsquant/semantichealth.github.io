It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in Asia. Encephalitis is an infection of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord. This infection often causes only mild symptoms, but prolonged swelling of the brain can cause permanent brain damage or death. Japanese encephalitis virus is carried and spread by mosquitoes. Ixiaro vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Ixiaro vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Ixiaro vaccine is recommended for people who live in or travel to areas where Japanese encephalitis is known to exist, or where an epidemic has recently occurred. You should receive the Ixiaro vaccine and booster dose at least 1 week prior to your arrival in an area where you may be exposed to the virus. Not everyone who travels to Asia needs to receive an Ixiaro vaccine. Follow your doctor instructions or the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ixiaro vaccine is also recommended for people who work in a research laboratory and may be exposed to Japanese encephalitis virus through needle-stick accidents or inhalation of viral droplets in the air. Like any vaccine, the Ixiaro vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person. ", "condition": "Japanese Encephalitis Virus Prophylaxis", "pregnancy": "B"},
