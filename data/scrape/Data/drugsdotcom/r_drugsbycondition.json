The pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos is different with an approximately four-hour lag time from that of immediate-release prednisone formulations. In clinical trials studying use of Rayos in RA, patients were administered Rayos at 10 p.m. with food. Given the delayed-release profile, this helps to achieve therapeutic prednisone blood levels at a time point when cytokine levels start rising during the middle of the night. While the pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos differs in terms of lag time from immediate-release prednisone, its absorption, distribution and elimination processes are comparable. This medicine is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to prednisone or to any of the excipients. Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids. Important Information about Rayos Rayos Clinical Data The FDA approval was supported by data bridging the pharmacokinetics of Rayos to immediate-release prednisone and data from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in RA (CAPRA-1 and 2) trials. The CAPRA-2 trial demonstrated that people with moderate to severe RA treated with Rayos experienced a statistically significant improvement in ACR20 response criteria compared to placebo. The CAPRA-1 trial supported the overall safety of Rayos. ", "condition": "RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis)", "pregnancy": "C"},

Unlike plasma, Kcentra does not require blood group typing or thawing, so it can be administered more quickly than frozen plasma. Kcentra is associated with the occurrence of blood clots when used as indicated, and carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of blood clots. The warning also explains that patients receiving Kcentra should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events, as both fatal and non-fatal arterial and venous thromboembolic complications have been reported in clinical trials and post marketing surveillance. Kcentra is made from the pooled plasma of healthy donors. It is processed in a way to minimize the risk of transmitting viral and other diseases. The FDA approval of Kcentra was based on a study of 216 patients who had been receiving VKA anticoagulation and who had acute major bleeding along with a clotting test value indicative of anticoagulant use.

The pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos is different with an approximately four-hour lag time from that of immediate-release prednisone formulations. In clinical trials studying use of Rayos in RA, patients were administered Rayos at 10 p.m. with food. Given the delayed-release profile, this helps to achieve therapeutic prednisone blood levels at a time point when cytokine levels start rising during the middle of the night. While the pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos differs in terms of lag time from immediate-release prednisone, its absorption, distribution and elimination processes are comparable. This medicine is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to prednisone or to any of the excipients. Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids. Important Information about Rayos Rayos Clinical Data The FDA approval was supported by data bridging the pharmacokinetics of Rayos to immediate-release prednisone and data from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in RA (CAPRA-1 and 2) trials. The CAPRA-2 trial demonstrated that people with moderate to severe RA treated with Rayos experienced a statistically significant improvement in ACR20 response criteria compared to placebo.
