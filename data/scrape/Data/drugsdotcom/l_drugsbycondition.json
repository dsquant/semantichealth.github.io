The pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos is different with an approximately four-hour lag time from that of immediate-release prednisone formulations. In clinical trials studying use of Rayos in RA, patients were administered Rayos at 10 p.m. with food. Given the delayed-release profile, this helps to achieve therapeutic prednisone blood levels at a time point when cytokine levels start rising during the middle of the night. While the pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos differs in terms of lag time from immediate-release prednisone, its absorption, distribution and elimination processes are comparable. This medicine is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to prednisone or to any of the excipients. Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids. Important Information about Rayos Rayos Clinical Data The FDA approval was supported by data bridging the pharmacokinetics of Rayos to immediate-release prednisone and data from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in RA (CAPRA-1 and 2) trials. The CAPRA-2 trial demonstrated that people with moderate to severe RA treated with Rayos experienced a statistically significant improvement in ACR20 response criteria compared to placebo. The CAPRA-1 trial supported the overall safety of Rayos. ", "condition": "Limited scleroderma (Scleroderma)", "pregnancy": "C"},

The pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos is different with an approximately four-hour lag time from that of immediate-release prednisone formulations. In clinical trials studying use of Rayos in RA, patients were administered Rayos at 10 p.m. with food. Given the delayed-release profile, this helps to achieve therapeutic prednisone blood levels at a time point when cytokine levels start rising during the middle of the night. While the pharmacokinetic profile of Rayos differs in terms of lag time from immediate-release prednisone, its absorption, distribution and elimination processes are comparable. This medicine is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to prednisone or to any of the excipients. Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids. Important Information about Rayos Rayos Clinical Data The FDA approval was supported by data bridging the pharmacokinetics of Rayos to immediate-release prednisone and data from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in RA (CAPRA-1 and 2) trials. The CAPRA-2 trial demonstrated that people with moderate to severe RA treated with Rayos experienced a statistically significant improvement in ACR20 response criteria compared to placebo. The CAPRA-1 trial supported the overall safety of Rayos. ", "condition": "Localized scleroderma (Scleroderma)", "pregnancy": "C"},
