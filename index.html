                    The MRURL PUF contains a row for each state and insurance provider with the URL to a JSON file that points to the Plans,
                    Providers and Formularies. This is the source of the physicians, addresses, plans for which they are in-network and accepting
                    patients and more. The Formularies contain the drugs that are covered in the plans, and the Plan JSON files contain the plan attributes.
                    The Machine Readable data constitutes a very broad but shallow tree structure where each branch is like the graph, below.

                    Semantic Health is a web application that helps people choose the right Obamacare plan.
                    Our users interact with our product through this inteface only.
                    We want this application to have a number of features that would help them accomplish their goals.
                    Here is a list of requirements for the webpage:

                  <li>Interactivity via faceted search.</li>
                  <li>Rank results using LETOR algorithm.</li>
                  <li>Collect clickstream data.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h3 class="text-center">Implementation</h3>
                <img src="/static/img/web/web-tech.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Web Technologies">
                <h3 class="text-center">Flask</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                  The above schematic shows all the components in our web application.
                  All of the requirements were satisfied by this setup.
                  The webserver is based on Flask.
                  This web framework is based on Python, and it is extremely easy to get a production server up and running.
                  Our web server manages all the backend web functionalities.
                  It takes in the user's input, validates it, and sends the query to the frontend.
                  It also has endpoints to log the visitor and clickstream data in a AWS RDS PostgreSQL database.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center">Searchkit</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                  The frontend utilized many elements from searchkit, an elasticsearch UI framework based on React.js.
                  We chose searchkit because it gave us a substantial headstart in the development of the UI.
                  It is easy to use and extremely customizable.
                  We were able to build an extremely interactive application which allows the user to do faceted search and input search.
                  A custom rescore query component allows the results to be re-ranked based on the LETOR algorithm.
                  Various event handlers were also present to assist in the recording of clickstream data.

                    Learn to Rank (LETOR) charaterizes search context for each user query,
                    records click-through rate data (CTR), and builds a ranking model to capture the relationship between
                    user preference and plan attributes, given a particular health status and realistic consideration.
                    Plan attributes, including policy category, drug and provider coverage are extracted into feature
                    vector. Pair-wise user preference is harvested based on reletive importance from browsing history.
                    Plan returned by ElasticSearch will be adjusted at runtime by rankings from the similar context
                    previously leanred by LETOR.

In the end we were very excited that SmartyStreets (Thank you Jefferson!) offered to support our project by providing an unlimited pull license which we eventually used, to pull Geo Locations for over a million plus providers.

                    Although the code is functional and tested, it has one major limitation with running on a large set of providers - the code uses Google to do a search and then scrapes the search results for any mention from one of the rating sites and then crawls the specific rating websites. Even with randomizing request headers and timing between request, search results returned 403 errors, mostly from Google blocking IP calls. So we were not able to fully use Provider ratings.

                    <b>Sponsored Search:</b> Just as plan rankings can be adjusted to surface the best plan, rankings
                    can be adjusted to coordinate with sponsors. This is a potential revenue stream with significant
                    potential. Considering that the health insurance advertising expenditure is nearly $20 billion,
                    just a percentage of that budget is significant. Considering the targeting capabilities of the
                    Semantic Health platform insurance advertisers will get significantly more bang for their buck.

                <p class="lead">
                    <b>Search Data and Purchase Data:</b> Semantic Health has data that's not available to anyone
                    else - what people actually look for and consider when searching or shopping for a health insurance
                    plan.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <b>Chatbots:</b> many common questions can be answered with chatbot technology used to hone
                    the personalization experience of Semantic Health. Chatbots can significantly reduce the needs
                    for human agents to step in and take over the more complex activities that may be required to
                    finalize an insurance plan purchase.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <b>Agents and Agency:</b> by becoming a licensed insurance seller in the states that require it
                    the Semantic Health data is extended beyond browsing to purchasing, increasing the value of the
                    data and measurable results of advertising dollars. Human agents can assist with those more complex issues.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <b>Free Form Query:</b> combined with voice input, free form text queries provide a level of
                    interaction unknown in the insurance industry today, all without human agency. The ability to
                    pull out the key pieces of information in a statement like, "I'm a housewife from central
                    Minnesota with 2 children, ages 4 and 6 and a husband with Type 2 diabetes" makes the entire
                    experience much more user friendly. Leveraging various voice API's available to provide the
                    voice to text combined with NLP processing to extract the meanings of the sentence we can leverage
                    much of what already exists today"
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <b>Mobile:</b> this seems like a no-brainer considering the ubiquitousness of mobile devices
                    over computers. Combined with free form voice query this can be an amazingly effective means of
                    shopping for insurance.
